# First-Fit Memory Allocation

## Definition:
First-Fit Memory Allocation is a memory allocation algorithm that allocates the first available memory block that is large enough to accommodate the process. The search for free memory starts from the beginning of the memory list and allocates the first suitable block found.

## Working of First-Fit Algorithm:
- The OS maintains a list of free memory blocks.
- When a process requests memory, the OS starts from the beginning of the list and allocates the first block that is large enough for the process.
- The remaining memory in the block, if any, becomes a smaller free block.
- If no suitable block is found, the process has to wait.

## Example of First-Fit Allocation:
Consider the following memory partitions and process sizes:

### Memory Partitions:
- 200 KB, 400 KB, 600 KB, 500 KB, 300 KB, 250 KB

### Processes:
- **Process P1** = 357 KB  
- **Process P2** = 210 KB  
- **Process P3** = 468 KB  
- **Process P4** = 491 KB

### Steps:
1. **P1 (357 KB)**: The first block that can fit this process is 400 KB. Allocate 357 KB, leaving 43 KB.
2. **P2 (210 KB)**: The first block that can fit this process is 600 KB. Allocate 210 KB, leaving 390 KB.
3. **P3 (468 KB)**: The first block that can fit this process is 500 KB. Allocate 468 KB, leaving 32 KB.
4. **P4 (491 KB)**: No partition is large enough to fit this process, so P4 is not allocated.

## Advantages of First-Fit Allocation:

| **Advantages**              | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Fast Allocation**          | Allocates memory quickly by selecting the first available block that fits, reducing search time. |
| **Simple Implementation**    | Easy to implement as it simply scans from the start and allocates the first suitable block. |
| **Low Overhead**             | Does not require scanning the entire list of memory blocks, minimizing computational overhead. |
| **Efficient for Small Lists** | Performs well when there are fewer processes and memory blocks, as the search is shorter. |

## Disadvantages of First-Fit Allocation:

| **Disadvantages**            | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **External Fragmentation**   | May leave large gaps of unused memory that cannot be allocated to new processes, leading to fragmentation. |
| **Suboptimal Memory Utilization** | Can result in poor memory usage, as larger memory blocks might be unnecessarily used by smaller processes. |
| **Unpredictable Allocation** | The first available block may not always be the most efficient, leading to memory wastage. |
| **Fragmentation Accumulates** | Over time, small free blocks can accumulate, making it harder to find contiguous free space for large processes. |

## Key Points to Remember:
- First Fit allocates memory quickly, reducing search time but may cause external fragmentation as it leaves gaps between memory blocks.
- It has a low overhead because the first available block is chosen, but it may not be the most efficient allocation.
