# Memory Management in Operating Systems

Memory management is a critical function in an operating system that handles the allocation, organization, and protection of memory resources. Efficient memory management ensures the smooth execution of processes and the optimal utilization of limited memory resources.

## Role of Memory Management

1. **Allocation**:  
   - Assigns memory blocks to processes when they request it.  
   - Tracks available memory and allocates it based on the process's needs.

2. **Deallocation**:  
   - Frees up memory when a process no longer needs it.  
   - Prevents memory leaks and makes memory available for other processes.

3. **Memory Organization**:  
   - Organizes memory efficiently by dividing it into blocks or pages.  
   - Ensures simpler allocation and deallocation.

4. **Memory Protection**:  
   - Prevents processes from accessing memory regions they are not authorized to access.  
   - Ensures process isolation and system stability.

5. **Memory Sharing**:  
   - Facilitates memory sharing between processes.  
   - Allows processes to access shared memory regions for efficient communication.

6. **Fragmentation Management**:  
   - Manages internal and external fragmentation, ensuring minimal memory wastage.  
   - Works to optimize memory allocation and deallocation.

### 1. Contiguous Memory Allocation
In contiguous memory allocation, each process is allocated a single continuous block of memory.

| Feature                     | Details                                                    |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Memory Organization**      | Memory blocks are located at a single continuous address range. |
| **Fragmentation**            | Prone to external fragmentation, where free memory is scattered. |
| **Efficiency**               | Simpler to implement but may lead to inefficient memory use. |
| **Example**                  | Single large partitioned blocks of memory.                 |

### 2. Non-Contiguous Memory Allocation
In non-contiguous memory allocation, memory is allocated in multiple non-adjacent blocks.

| Feature                     | Details                                                    |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Memory Organization**      | Memory blocks are scattered across various physical memory locations. |
| **Fragmentation**            | Reduces external fragmentation but may face internal fragmentation. |
| **Efficiency**               | More efficient memory usage, especially in complex systems. |
| **Example**                  | Paging and segmentation.                                  |

## Logical Address vs Physical Address

- **Logical Address**:  
  - The address generated by the CPU during program execution.  
  - Also known as a **virtual address** since it doesnâ€™t exist physically.  
  - It is mapped to a physical address using the **Memory Management Unit (MMU)**.

- **Physical Address**:  
  - The actual address in memory where data is stored.  
  - The user does not directly interact with physical addresses.  
  - Logical addresses must be translated into physical addresses before they are used by the system.

## Fragmentation in Memory

### Internal Fragmentation
- **Definition**: Occurs when allocated memory blocks are larger than required, leaving unused space within allocated memory.  
- **Common in**: Fixed partitioning systems.

### External Fragmentation
- **Definition**: Occurs when free memory is scattered across the system in small blocks, making it difficult to allocate contiguous memory even though sufficient total memory exists.  
- **Common in**: Contiguous memory allocation systems.
