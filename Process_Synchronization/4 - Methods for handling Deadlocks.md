# **Methods for Handling Deadlock**

## ✅ **1. Deadlock Prevention**

**Definition:**  
Deadlock prevention aims to **prevent one or more of the four necessary conditions** from occurring.  
This can be achieved by ensuring that at least **one of the conditions is not satisfied**.

### ✅ **How to Prevent Each Condition:**

#### **1. Mutual Exclusion:**

- Use **resource sharing** where possible to allow multiple processes to access the resource concurrently (e.g., read-only files).
- Implement **resource partitioning** to allow different processes to access different parts of the resource concurrently.

#### **2. Hold and Wait:**

- Use the **"request all resources at once"** approach, where a process must request all necessary resources at the start of its execution.
- Alternatively, use **resource allocation in a predetermined order**, ensuring processes acquire resources in a specific sequence to avoid circular waiting.

#### **3. No Preemption:**

- Allow **resource preemption**, where resources can be **forcibly reclaimed** from a process if another process needs them.
- The preempted process resumes execution once the resources are available again.

#### **4. Circular Wait:**

- Use **resource ordering (resource numbering)** to break the circular wait condition.
- Assign a **unique number to each resource** and ensure processes request resources in increasing order.
- This prevents cyclic dependencies among processes.

## ✅ **2. Deadlock Avoidance**

**Definition:**  
In deadlock avoidance, the system dynamically grants resources to processes **only if the system remains in a safe state** after the allocation.

A **safe state** is one in which there is at least one sequence of processes that can complete their execution without causing a deadlock.

### ✅ **Banker’s Algorithm (Deadlock Avoidance Algorithm)**

The **Banker's Algorithm** ensures that the system remains in a safe state by only allocating resources **if doing so will not result in deadlock**.  
Each process declares the **maximum resources** it may need at the start, and resource requests are granted only if the system remains in a safe state after the allocation.

#### ✅ **Key Concepts:**

- **Safe State:**

  - A state where the system can allocate resources to all processes in some sequence **without causing deadlock**.

- **Unsafe State:**
  - A state where there is a possibility of **deadlock occurring** in the future.

#### ✅ **Steps in Banker’s Algorithm:**

1. **Request Resources:**

   - A process requests resources.

2. **Check Availability:**

   - The system verifies if the **requested resources are available**.

3. **Simulate Allocation:**

   - Temporarily allocate resources to the process and **simulate the result**.

4. **Check Safe State:**

   - Ensure that the system remains in a **safe state** after the allocation.

5. **Grant or Deny:**
   - **Grant the request** if the system remains in a safe state.
   - **Deny the request** if it leads to an **unsafe state**, making the process wait.

#### ✅ **Data Structures:**

- **Available:**

  - Tracks **available instances** of each resource type.
  - Example: `Available[j] = K` → (K instances of resource `R[j]` are available).

- **Max:**

  - Maximum number of **resources each process** may request.
  - Example: `Max[i][j]` → (Maximum instances of `R[j]` needed by process `P[i]`).

- **Allocation:**

  - Resources **currently allocated** to each process.
  - Example: `Allocation[i][j] = K` → (Process `P[i]` holds `K` instances of `R[j]`).

- **Need:**

  - Resources still required by each process.
  - Formula: `Need[i][j] = Max[i][j] - Allocation[i][j]`.

- **Finish:**
  - Boolean array to indicate if a process has **completed**.

#### Example Execution:

**1.** Process P1 requests resources.

**2.** Check if Available resources can fulfill the request.

**3.** Simulate allocation and check for a safe state.

**4.** Grant the request if safe; otherwise, deny and make the process wait.

## ✅ **3. Deadlock Ignorance**

**Definition:**  
In **deadlock ignorance**, the system assumes that **deadlocks are so rare** that it is more efficient to **ignore them** rather than prevent or avoid them.

The system doesn't attempt to detect or handle deadlocks and may rely on **manual intervention** (e.g., restarting the system) when a deadlock occurs.

## ✅ **Example:**

- This is the approach taken by **Windows** and **UNIX**.
- The system doesn't actively prevent deadlocks but may rely on **administrators** to reboot the system if one occurs.

### **Advantages:**

- **Improves performance** by eliminating deadlock checking overhead.

### **Disadvantages:**

- Deadlocks can cause **system-wide failures**, especially if critical processes are affected.
