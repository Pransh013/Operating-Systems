| **Aspect**                      | **Details**                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single-User Operating System** | A **Single-User Operating System** is designed for one user at a time, commonly found in mobile phones and embedded systems. It can be divided into two types: **single-tasking** and **multi-tasking**. |


### Features of Single-User Operating System

| **Feature**                  | **Explanation**                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No I/O Scheduling**         | Minimal or no complex input/output scheduling is required because the system is dedicated to a single user. |
| **User-Specific**             | The system operates exclusively for a single user, simplifying process management and resource allocation. |
| **Exclusive Resource Allocation** | Since only one user is involved, the OS can allocate CPU time, memory, and I/O devices without any contention. |

## 2. Multi-User OS

| **Aspect**                    | **Details**                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Definition**                 | A multi-user OS allows multiple users to access and interact with a single system running the same OS, typically over a network.                             |
| **Multiple Users**             | Supports simultaneous access by several users, often from remote machines or terminals connected via a network.                                               |
| **Shared Resources**           | Users share system resources like CPU, memory, and peripherals (e.g., printers).                                                                            |
| **Network-based Access**       | Users typically access the system via network connections from different terminals or computers.                                                            |
| **System Management**          | Manages tasks for multiple users concurrently, ensuring efficient operation.                                                                                 |
| **Difference from Single-User OS** | A single-user OS allows only one user at a time, whereas a multi-user OS supports access by multiple users simultaneously.                                    |
| **Primary Purpose**            | Developed to support time-sharing & batch processing, mainly for mainframe systems. Maximizes resource utilization by distributing processing time.            |
| **Common Usage**               | Used in large organizations, government institutions, universities, and server environments (e.g., Ubuntu Server, Windows Server).                           |
| **Importance**                 | Ensures high reliability as multiple users depend on the system simultaneously.

| **Description**                                                                                                    | **Advantages**                                                                                                                       | **Disadvantages**                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| In Batch OS, similar jobs are grouped into batches and executed sequentially. Users submit jobs to an operator, who queues them for processing. There’s no direct user interaction. | - Processors know the job duration in advance. <br> - Multiple users can share the system. | - Starvation may occur if long jobs block shorter ones. <br> - Operators need expertise in batch systems. <br> - Hard to debug and costly. <br> - Not interactive. |
| Jobs are processed based on First-Come, First-Serve (FCFS). A resident monitor program stays in memory to manage job transitions. | - Resident monitor eliminates idle CPU time. <br> - Efficient for repetitive tasks. | - If a job fails, others wait for an unknown time. <br> - Not suitable for jobs needing user input (e.g., two numbers from a console).                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                    |

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A Multiprocessing Operating System uses more than one processor in a system to perform tasks simultaneously, achieving parallel processing. Each processor can execute its own process, leading to improved performance and reliability, increasing system throughput and performance. | - Increased reliability: If one processor fails, another can take over the task. <br> - Increased throughput: Multiple processors allow more work to be done. | - Complexity: Managing multiple CPUs simultaneously is more complex. <br> - Cost: Multiprocessing systems are typically more expensive to build and maintain. |
