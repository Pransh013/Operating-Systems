---

## ⏱️ **5. What is the purpose of a Scheduler in an OS?**
- A **scheduler** decides which process gets CPU time.  
- It **prevents starvation** and ensures efficient execution of all processes.

### 📌 **Follow-up:** How does Round-Robin scheduling differ from FCFS?
- **Round-Robin:** Assigns a **time slice** to each process and cycles through them.  
- **FCFS:** Executes processes in the **order they arrive**, without preemption.

---

## 🔥 **6. Explain the concept of Virtual Memory.**
- **Virtual memory** extends RAM using **disk space**.  
- It enables the system to run **larger programs** even when RAM is full.

### 📌 **Follow-up:** How does the OS manage swapping between RAM and the hard disk?
- The OS uses a **page table** to track memory locations.  
- When a page fault occurs, the OS **swaps inactive pages** from RAM to disk.

---

## 🚫 **7. What is a deadlock? How can it be prevented?**
- A **deadlock** occurs when processes hold resources and **wait indefinitely** for each other.  
- This creates a **circular dependency**, blocking execution.

### 📌 **Follow-up:** What is the difference between deadlock prevention and avoidance?
- **Prevention:** Ensures that at least **one deadlock condition** cannot occur.
- **Avoidance:** Uses algorithms like **Banker's Algorithm** to allocate resources safely.

---

## ⚙️ **8. What are the different types of Operating Systems?**
- **Batch OS:** Executes jobs without user interaction.  
- **Time-Sharing OS:** Allows multiple users to share system resources.  
- **Distributed OS:** Manages a group of independent computers.  
- **Real-Time OS:** Provides immediate responses to inputs.

### 📌 **Follow-up:** How does a distributed OS differ from a real-time OS?
- **Distributed OS:** Manages resources across a **network**.  
- **Real-time OS:** Ensures **time-sensitive tasks** are executed on time.

---

## 🔥 **9. What is the difference between paging and segmentation?**
- **Paging:** Divides memory into **fixed-size pages**.  
- **Segmentation:** Divides memory into **variable-sized segments**.

### 📌 **Follow-up:** Why is paging more widely used?
- **Paging** eliminates **external fragmentation**.
- Simplifies **memory management**, making it more efficient.

---

## 🔒 **10. What is process synchronization? Why is it important?**
- **Process synchronization** ensures multiple processes do not access **shared data** simultaneously.  
- Prevents **data inconsistency** and race conditions.

### 📌 **Follow-up:** How does a mutex differ from a semaphore?
- **Mutex:** Allows only **one process** to access a resource at a time.  
- **Semaphore:** Allows **multiple processes** to access a limited resource.

---

## ⚡ **11. What is the difference between user mode and kernel mode?**
- **User Mode:** Limited access to **hardware resources**.  
- **Kernel Mode:** Full access to **system resources**.

### 📌 **Follow-up:** How does the OS switch between these modes?
- When a program requests a **system call**, the CPU switches to **kernel mode**.  
- It then switches back to **user mode** after executing the request.

---

## 🔧 **12. Explain the concept of I/O management in an OS.**
- The OS manages **I/O devices** for efficient data transfer.  
- Uses **buffering, caching, and spooling** to enhance performance.

### 📌 **Follow-up:** How does DMA (Direct Memory Access) improve I/O performance?
- **DMA** transfers data directly between **devices and memory**, bypassing the CPU.  
- This reduces CPU involvement and **speeds up I/O** operations.

---

## ⚡ **13. What are interrupts? How does the OS handle them?**
- **Interrupts** are signals from hardware or software.  
- They tell the OS to stop a task and handle a **higher-priority event**.

### 📌 **Follow-up:** What is the difference between hardware and software interrupts?
- **Hardware Interrupts:** Generated by devices like **keyboards or disks**.  
- **Software Interrupts:** Triggered by programs, e.g., **division by zero**.

---

## 🔄 **14. What is context switching in an OS?**

### 📌 **Follow-up:** How does context switching affect performance?
- Frequent context switching introduces **overhead**.  
- Reduces CPU efficiency and performance.

## 🛠️ **15. What is the difference between Multitasking, Multithreading, and Multiprocessing?**
- **Multitasking:** Runs multiple **processes concurrently**.  
- **Multithreading:** Runs multiple **threads concurrently** within a process.  
- **Multiprocessing:** Uses **multiple CPUs** to run processes.

### 📌 **Follow-up:** How does the OS ensure fair CPU time distribution?
- The OS uses **scheduling algorithms** (e.g., Round-Robin) to allocate CPU time fairly.

## 🔗 **17. What is the difference between static and dynamic linking?**
- **Static Linking:** Libraries are embedded in the executable.  
- **Dynamic Linking:** Libraries are linked **during runtime**.

### 📌 **Follow-up:** When is dynamic linking preferred?
