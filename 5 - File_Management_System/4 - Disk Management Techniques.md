# Disk Management

Modern operating systems provide a wide range of services, and **disk management** is one of the key functions. The main goal of disk management is to **organize, store, and retrieve data efficiently** on a physical storage device like a hard disk or solid-state drive (SSD).

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Core Operating System Management Functions**

- **Process Management:** Manages the execution of processes, multitasking, and CPU scheduling.
- **Memory Management:** Controls memory allocation to ensure efficient use of RAM.
- **File and Disk Management:** Organizes data storage on **secondary storage devices**.
- **I/O System Management:** Manages **input/output operations**, including device communication.

---

## üî• **Key Responsibilities of Disk Management**

- Track **file locations** on disk, including fragmented files.
- Perform **efficient read and write** operations on files.
- Ensure **data integrity** and optimal disk space utilization.

## üîë **Important Disk Management Concepts**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Disk Format**
- Preparing a disk for use by **dividing it into sectors and tracks**.
- Ensures proper data organization and accessibility.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Booting from Disk**
- **Loading the OS kernel** from the disk's boot block into memory to start the system.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Bad Block Recovery**
- Handling faulty sectors on the disk using techniques like **sector sparing**.

## üîß **Low-Level vs. Logical Format**

### üõ†Ô∏è **Low-Level Format (Physical Format)**

- Divides the disk into **sectors** that the disk controller can read/write.
- Each sector contains:
  - **Header (metadata)**  
  - **Data**  
  - **Error Correction Code (ECC)**  
- Conducted in **two stages**:
  1. Dividing the disk into **cylinder groups**, each treated as a logical disk.
  2. Creating the **first file system structure** on the disk.

### üìÇ **Logical Format (File System Creation)**

- The OS **initializes the file system** on the disk after low-level formatting.
- The OS keeps track of **free and allocated disk space** using clusters:
  - **Disk I/O** runs in **blocks**.
  - **File I/O** runs in **clusters**.

---

## üöÄ **Disk Booting Process**

- **Boot Block:**  
  - Contains the initial program needed to **load the operating system**.  
- When a computer powers up:
  - The **bootstrap loader** in the ROM locates the OS kernel in the **boot block**.  
  - It loads the OS kernel into memory and starts the system.  
- The bootstrap process:
  - **Initializes the system hardware**.  
  - Starts the **operating system**.

## üíæ **Bad Blocks**

Bad blocks are **faulty sectors** on a disk that cannot reliably store data. They are handled in several ways:

### üî• **Bad Block Handling Techniques**
- **Sector Sparing (Replacement):**  
  - Replacing bad sectors with **spare ones**.
- **Data Recovery:**  
  - Recovering data from soft errors or **bad sectors**.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Bad Block Management Stages**
- **Factory-Level:**  
  - Disks may come with **pre-existing bad sectors**, managed by the controller.
- **Operational-Level:**  
  - Disks develop **bad blocks over time**, requiring constant monitoring and recovery.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Disk Management Techniques**

### üîπ **Partitioning**
- Dividing a single physical disk into **multiple logical partitions**.
- Each partition is treated as a **separate storage device** by the OS.

### üîπ **Formatting**
- Prepares a disk by creating a **file system**, erasing all previous data.

### üîπ **File System Management**
- Controls how **files are stored, retrieved, and organized** on the disk.
- **Popular file systems:**
  - **NTFS** (Windows)
  - **FAT32** (Windows)
  - **ext4** (Linux)

### üîπ **Disk Space Allocation**
Allocating space for files on the disk using different methods:

- **Contiguous Allocation:**  
  - Files occupy **continuous blocks**.  
- **Linked Allocation:**  
  - Files are scattered, with **pointers connecting the blocks**.  
- **Indexed Allocation:**  
  - An **index block holds pointers** to the file blocks.  

### üîπ **Disk Defragmentation**
- Rearranges **fragmented files** to optimize space and performance.
- **Fragmentation** occurs as files are created, modified, or deleted, causing pieces of the file to scatter across the disk.

## ‚ö° **Raw Disk Access**

- Some operating systems allow **direct access to disk partitions** without any file system overhead, called **raw I/O**.  
- This provides **faster, sequential access** to data but:
  - Does not support **advanced file system features** like file permissions or indexing.
