# File Systems in Operating Systems

A file system is a crucial component of an operating system (OS) that manages files on storage devices like hard drives. It handles the storage, organization, retrieval, and deletion of files and directories. A file system helps users and applications interact with data, ensuring that files are stored and accessed efficiently. Some operating systems, such as Ubuntu, treat everything as a file.

## Core Responsibilities of File Systems

- **File Structure Maintenance:** Ensures files are organized using optimal data structures.
- **Free Space Management:** Reclaims space when files are deleted, and reallocates it to new files.
- **Disk Space Allocation:** Determines where on the disk to store files.
- **Data Location Tracking:** Keeps track of all file blocks, even if they are stored non-contiguously.

## File System Structure

Most operating systems use a **layered approach** to manage file systems, where each layer has specific responsibilities:

1. **Physical Layer:**  
   - Interacts directly with the hardware (storage devices).  
   - Manages low-level disk operations.

2. **File Organization Layer:**  
   - Manages how files are stored, retrieved, and organized on the disk.  
   - Handles file allocation, free space management, and data placement.

3. **File Manipulation Layer:**  
   - Provides services like opening, reading, writing, and deleting files.  
   - Offers APIs and system calls for file operations.

## Storage Structure in Operating Systems

Data in a computer system can be stored in various types of storage, organized in a **storage hierarchy**:

### 💡 **Volatile Storage:**  
- Loses data when power is off.

- **Registers:**  
  - Fastest memory, used for temporary data in the CPU.
- **Cache:**  
  - Small, high-speed memory for frequently accessed data.
- **Main Memory (RAM):**  
  - Temporary storage used for active processes.

---

### 💾 **Non-Volatile Storage:**  
- Retains data even after power loss.

- **Electronic Disk (SSD):**  
  - Faster storage, used for frequently accessed files.
- **Magnetic Disk (HDD):**  
  - Slower but larger storage, used for bulk data.
- **Optical Disk (CD/DVD):**  
  - Used for permanent storage and distribution.
- **Magnetic Tape:**  
  - Slow, sequential storage used for backup and archival purposes.
